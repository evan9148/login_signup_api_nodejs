# login_signup_api_nodejs

so , here i have made one login signup api which in simple way means without any auth token..
firstly, i have create one api for signup which does if the email exist in our mysql databases then i have console it 
that user is allready exist.. if not i am inserting the details of the user like :
name,email,password that's all about signup api which i have created...

Then, comes login so now in login api where we need to check the email and password that to login 
So, what i did it means that i am checking email and password whether it have been exists or not if exist then i am printing you have 
logged in successfully or else invalid email and password i am consoling ....


This all the things which i have done creating signup and login api...
